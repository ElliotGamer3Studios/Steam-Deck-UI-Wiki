# How to use

1. Include the link to the nearest header in the wiki. 
2. Provide the old version verbatim, not including the header, under the old Info Section. 
3. Provide the updated information in the same format with any updates underlined and italicized followed by a sub-script number. (**_Updated Info_**<sub>1</sub>) This can be done in markdown using ```**_Updated Info_**<sub>1</sub>```.
4. Provide justification for each update in a numbered list, using the numbers to corelate to the updated information.
5. Provide any additional information under your justifications. This is for info on things such as how to reproduce tests.
